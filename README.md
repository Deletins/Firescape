# Firescape
A discord bot I made last year to make remote learning easier.

Last year, schools were shut down and I preferred to do remote learning. This bot serves multiple purposes, ranging from announcing when classes start, posting jokes, tinkering with random number selection, and even creating an interactive roles message to self-give roles to server members. Obviously, this bot is not the most advanceed nor the most useful, but it's the start to my coding endeavors and the start of my dive into STEM fields.

# Miscellaneous Info
The config.json file is hidden since it contains the Discord Bot's token, but the file also includes the prefix. The prefix for the bot is "~", as also stated if you use "~help".
